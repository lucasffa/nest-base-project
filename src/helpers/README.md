# Helpers Directory

## Overview

The `helpers` directory in the `nest-base-project` plays a crucial role in providing utility classes and functions that assist in various operations across the application. This directory is designed to contain reusable logic that enhances modularity and maintains the clean architecture of the application.

## Component

### `PermissionChecker`

- **Purpose**: `PermissionChecker` is a service class designed to encapsulate the logic for checking user permissions and roles within the application.
  
- **Functionality**: 
  - **Permission Checking (`hasPermission`)**: Determines if a given role has the required permissions. This method simplifies checking whether a user's role includes certain permissions, aiding in permission-based access control.
  - **Action Authorization (`canPerformAction`)**: Evaluates if a user can perform a certain action, considering both their role and specific permissions. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where actions are restricted based on both user identity (UUID) and their role permissions.
  
- **Usage**: 
  - Utilized primarily in guards and services to validate whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific operation.
  - Enhances security by centralizing permission and role verification logic.

## Best Practices

- **Reusability**: Designed to be a reusable service, `PermissionChecker` can be injected into various parts of the application where role and permission checks are required.

- **Centralized Permission Logic**: Keeps the permission-related logic centralized, making the application easier to maintain and update.

- **Modular Design**: Adheres to the principles of clean architecture by abstracting and encapsulating permission-checking logic away from business logic.

## Integration

- **Dependency Injection**: `PermissionChecker` is injectable and utilizes NestJS's dependency injection system. It's typically injected into services or guards where permission checks are necessary.

- **Dynamic Permission Checking**: Can be used dynamically across various modules and services, allowing for flexible and context-specific permission checks.

## Conclusion

The `helpers` directory, with its `PermissionChecker` class, provides a powerful and centralized way to manage role and permission checks within the `nest-base-project`. It exemplifies the application's commitment to modular design, clean architecture, and security best practices.
