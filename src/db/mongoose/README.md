# Mongoose Module for NestJS

This directory contains the implementation of a custom `MongooseModule` for integrating MongoDB with a NestJS application using Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

## Overview

The custom `MongooseModule` in this directory is designed to provide a structured and centralized way of handling MongoDB connections and operations in a NestJS application. It separates the concerns of database connection management and operations, thereby enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.

## Structure

The directory consists of the following main components:

- **MongooseModule (mongoose.module.ts):** A global module responsible for initializing the MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
- **MongooseService (mongoose.service.ts):** A service that provides methods for database operations. It's the primary interface for other modules to interact with MongoDB.

## Implementation Details

### MongooseModule

- **Global Scope:** The module is marked as `@Global()`, making it globally available across the application. It ensures that only a single MongoDB connection is maintained.
- **OnModuleInit Lifecycle Hook:** The connection to MongoDB is established in the `onModuleInit` method, ensuring that the database connection is ready before the application starts handling requests.
- **ConfigService Integration:** The module uses `ConfigService` to access the MongoDB URI from the application's configuration, allowing for flexible configuration management.

### MongooseService

- **Database Operations:** The service includes methods for performing database operations. Currently, it has a `saveLog` method for saving log entries to the database.
- **LogModel Integration:** The service uses the `LogModel`, a Mongoose model, to interact with the MongoDB collection designated for logs.

## Usage

To use the `MongooseService` in other parts of the application:

1. Import `MongooseModule` in the desired module (e.g., `LogModule`).
2. Inject `MongooseService` into services or controllers where database operations are required.

## Example

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseService } from '../db/mongoose/mongoose.service';

@Injectable()
export class SomeService {
  constructor(private mongooseService: MongooseService) {}

  async someDatabaseOperation() {
    // Use mongooseService methods here
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Database Operations:** Additional methods can be added to `MongooseService` to handle a wider range of database operations.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Further enhance error handling and integrate a logging mechanism to record database-related errors and events.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Implement performance monitoring to track and optimize database queries and operations.
