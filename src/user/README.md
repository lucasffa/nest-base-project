# User Module in `nest-base-project`

## Overview

The `user` module is a fundamental component of the `nest-base-project`, a NestJS application designed for robust and secure user management. It encompasses functionalities ranging from CRUD operations to advanced authentication and access control mechanisms, embodying best practices for modern backend development.

## Structure

```

├── dto/
│   ├── base-user-response.dto.ts
│   ├── create-user.dto.ts
│   ├── login.dto.ts
│   ├── other-user-responses.dto.ts
│   ├── update-user.dto.ts

```

### Key Components

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Located in `dto/`, these files define the structure and validation rules for incoming data (e.g., `CreateUserDto`, `UpdateUserDto`) and response formats (`BaseUserResponseDto`, `other-user-responses.dto.ts`).

- **User Controller (`user.controller.ts`)**: Manages incoming HTTP requests, orchestrating user-related operations such as registration, profile updates, and account management. It employs decorators for route definitions and integrates with the `auth` module for role-based and permission-based access control.

- **User Service (`user.service.ts`)**: Implements business logic related to user operations. It interfaces with the `User` entity for database interactions and utilizes services like `PermissionChecker` for enforcing access policies.

- **User Entity (`user.entity.ts`)**: Represents the `User` entity in the database, detailing the structure and relationships of user data.

## Features

- **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: Supports full lifecycle management of user accounts, including create, read, update, and delete functionalities.

- **Soft Deletion**: Facilitates reversible deletion of user records, enhancing data management and recovery options.

- **Activation and Deactivation**: Enables toggling the activation status of user accounts, allowing for flexible account management.

- **Role-Based and Permission-Based Access Control**: Integrates sophisticated access control mechanisms to regulate operations based on user roles and permissions.

- **Advanced Authentication**: Supports secure user authentication processes, including token generation and validation.

- **Password Security**: Implements bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring high levels of security for user credentials.

## Integration

- **Auth Module Interaction**: Closely integrated with the `auth` module, the `user` module leverages authentication and authorization functionalities to secure user-related endpoints.

- **Service Layer Collaboration**: The `UserService` collaborates with other services like `PermissionChecker` to enforce role and permission checks, ensuring that operations are performed within the bounds of the user's capabilities.

- **Entity and Database Management**: Utilizes the `User` entity to interact with the database, managing user data efficiently and securely.

## Security and Best Practices

- **JWT Authentication**: Leverages JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user sessions.

- **Encryption and Hashing**: Employs bcrypt for password hashing, safeguarding user passwords against potential breaches.

- **Validation and Sanitization**: Implements robust validation mechanisms through DTOs, ensuring that only valid and sanitized data is processed.

- **SOLID Principles**: Adheres to SOLID principles, promoting a scalable, maintainable, and robust architecture.

- **Modular Design**: Structured in a modular fashion, facilitating code reusability, ease of testing, and future enhancements.

## Documentation

The module is thoroughly documented, with extensive README files in both the main `user` directory and the `dto` subdirectory. These documents provide detailed insights into the module's functionality, architecture, and integration points, serving as a valuable resource for developers.
