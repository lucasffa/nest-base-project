# nest-base-project

## Overview

The "nest-base-project" is a NestJS-based backend application designed to demonstrate robust API development practices. Leveraging the powerful features of NestJS, this project showcases a fully functional user management system with authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations on user data.

## Features

- **Full CRUD Operations on User**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete user entities.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented using JWT tokens and role-based access control.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for robust, relational data management.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and Moderator roles with specific permissions.
- **Password Encryption**: Secures user passwords using bcrypt.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Implements DTOs and custom decorators for input validation and structured error responses.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
src
├── auth
│   ├── decorators
│   ├── guards
│   ├── strategies
│   └── ...
├── user
│   ├── dto
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- **auth**: Contains authentication logic, including JWT strategies, guards, and decorators.
- **user**: Manages user-related operations, including controllers and services for user handling.

### Key Components

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses to the client.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and interact with the database.
- **Entities**: Represent tables in the database, defining the structure of data.
- **Modules**: Organize code into functional units.
- **Decorators**: Extend the functionality of classes or methods, used for roles and validation.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define the format of data for incoming requests.

## Technologies

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM tool to interact with the database in an object-oriented manner.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **JWT**: Used for securing the authentication process.
- **bcrypt**: A library to help hash passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables setup (JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Set up the database and environment variables.
4. Run the application: `npm run start`.

## Usage

The application exposes endpoints for user management and authentication:

- `/users`: Perform CRUD operations on users.
- `/auth/login`: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.

### Example Requests

```
POST /users
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  ...
}
```

## Security

This project implements several security practices:

- **JWT for Authentication**: Ensures secure transmission of user credentials.
- **Password Hashing**: Protects user passwords using bcrypt.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to certain functionalities based on user roles.

## Testing

- Unit tests for services and controllers.
- Integration tests for endpoints.

### Running Tests

Execute `npm run test` to run the test suite.
